# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a contact form that validates user-submitted email addresses. The form is a critical part of a website as it provides a channel for users to communicate directly with a website's owner or support team. In our modern and digital age, many users prefer to contact businesses or organizations via email. Therefore, a contact form that validates email addresses is an essential feature to ensure the reliability of the submitted contact information. This form can be used in various contexts such as customer feedback, technical support, or inquiries about products or services.

# Requirements
The developed contact form must satisfy the following evaluation criteria:
1. **Contact form**: The web page must contain a contact form that users can fill out and submit.
2. **Email validation**: The contact form must validate the email address entered by the user. An invalid email address should not be accepted.
3. **Bootstrap styled**: The form must be styled using Bootstrap to ensure a clean and professional look and feel.

# Installation & Setup
To use the contact form on your website:
1. Copy the HTML file to your server.
2. Include the link to the Bootstrap CSS in your HTML.
3. Include the JavaScript code in your HTML.
4. Replace the alert in the JavaScript code with your own code to handle the form submission. This could be an AJAX call to your server, for example.
5. Test the form by filling it out and submitting it. Make sure to test it with both valid and invalid email addresses to ensure the validation works correctly.

# Usage Instructions
To use the form, users should enter their email address and a message, then click the "Submit" button. If the entered email address is not in the correct format, an error message will be displayed, and the form will not be submitted. The correct format for an email address is something like 'name@example.com'. Once a valid email address has been entered, the error message will be cleared, and the form can be submitted.

# Technical Details
The form is implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS (via Bootstrap) for the styling, and JavaScript for the functionality. The JavaScript code is responsible for handling the form submission event and validating the email address. Email validation is performed using a regular expression that checks if the entered email address is in the correct format.

# Troubleshooting
If the form does not validate the email address as expected, check the JavaScript console for any errors. If there is an error in the JavaScript code, it could prevent the form submission event handler from being set up correctly. Also, ensure that the email input field and the email error message div have the correct IDs, as these are used in the JavaScript code to get references to these elements.
